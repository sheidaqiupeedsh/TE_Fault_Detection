bellow you will read the information on raw data of Tennessee Eastman Process:
The model we are going to train is "CNN_LSTM"

How many variables (sensors) do we have?
What is the time resolution?
How long is each simulation run?
How are faults encoded?
When does the fault start?

What is ONE sample for the CNN-LSTM?
